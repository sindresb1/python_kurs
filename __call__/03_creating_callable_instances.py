# If you want the instances of a given class to be callable, then you need to implement the
# .__call__() special method in the underlying class. This method enables you to call the
# instances of your class as you'd call regular functions.

# Unlike other special methods, .__call__() doesnâ€™t have special requirements for what arguments 
# it must accept. It works like any other instance method in the sense that it takes self as its 
# first argument and can take as many extra arguments as you need.
